# Platformer Intro Cutscene

## Introduction 

In my project, I decided to try recreating an intro cutscene to a platformer which could convey core gameplay mechanics as well as setting the scene for the story. I've always had the idea for a puzzle platformer with the mechanic of diving through the ground to get to otherwise inaccessible areas and have always thought about how the character may have come into that situation. This was a nice guide for my project as it got me thinking about how I could not only introduce the setting but also the core mechanic. Using the interactive opening of Toby Fox's Deltarune and the cinematic prelude to Team Cherry's Hollow Knight as inspiration helped pinpoint my intentions with the project. 

 

## Planning 

I racked my brain for a while trying to figure out where I should start. This lead to me looking back at my past little personal projects I’ve started but have never gone anywhere with. I found a character design of mine that I liked and started there, wanting to reuse it for this project.

I kept the cutesy aesthetic of the character I originally designed it with, wanting it to be a contrast for the darker and heavier themes I would like the game to convey. Still, I made sure the design was simple as to make it not only more recognisable but also easier to animate with, giving it a clear silhouette of two strips of hair down the sides and one tuft at the top. I also kept with the overalls, deciding it’s simple enough.

I then started working on a storyboard to follow so I had an idea what assets I needed to create. Including the mechanic in the intro was imperative as I wanted it on the forefront of the player's mind throughout their gameplay as a crucial mechanic. The story follows a girl running from home only to find herself in some kind of simulation located high above an abandoned city. She, after not long, finds herself falling forcing her, and by extension the player, to use her "Dive" ability to cushion the fall. 

 

## Designing and Concept Art 

I wanted part of the introduction to have what would be actual assets used in the main part of the game, so I created a mock running cycle for the player character in red. This not only allows me to focus more on the general shape of the player character then the details like colour, but also allows me to keep it as a base in case I were to add any other characters to the game.

[INSERT STARDEW IMAGE] 

I took inspiration from ConcernedApe’s character shape in Stardew Valley, leaving out the harsh black outlines in favour for more subtle shading to convey a softer shape. This really gives the character a gentle atmosphere like a young child frolicking through a field of flowers on a warm summer’s day.

Next came the door which started off looking flat. It didn’t take much tinkering to find a design that I was happy with, taking inspiration from the shading of doors in Deltarune helped massively. The rest of the assets were pretty much drawn by hand following the designs I used on the storyboard. I split the frame of the player character falling in two as I wanted to convey depth similar to how legendary cards in LocalThunk’s Balatro are displayed.

## Finalising Main Asset Designs

Following on from the player character’s design, I kept the colours quite pastel. I streamlined the design by giving the face the most detail, of up to two shades, while keeping the body shadeless. This simplified the clothing design of overalls and a v-neck t-shirt, preventing it from being a mess of too many colours.

For the gameplay section, I created a small tileset basing off a grass tileset I found on opengameart.org. I created two variations, one with and one without flowers. The plan was to sprinkle the flower tiles in with the regular ones, but I never managed to fit them in on time. 

 

## Cleanup And Extra Additions

The intro starts with the door opening slowly. I added a black background slowly turning white to add tension like how some dramatic transitions are dealt with in all forms of media. The scene then opens to the player character running across a grassy field, displaying how the gameplay will look in the actual game. The colours used for this section are all bright and vibrant showcasing the dream-like world that the player character is about to leave behind. I then had the next frames slide in, reading similar to a comic book, giving the player the run by of the next events.  

On the third and fourth frames, the player and the ground are rotated and zoomed in as to convey the player is falling at a high speed from their simulated neighbourhood up in the clouds. The background also shifts to black here as the colours become more muted displaying the contrast to the bright, colourful field. The word “Dive!” then flashes on screen signalling to the player to use the main Dive ability. The player character then “dives” into the ground as a magic effect is played behind them.  

[INPUT NOITA SPELL] 

I drew inspiration from Nolla Games’ spells from their game Noita for this extra addition as I felt it adds more power behind the dive. 

 

## Conclusion 

I believe the game intro came quite close to what I had envisioned when I first started this project. I’m happy to breathe life back into this character I had created years ago and give them some form of a coherent story. If I were to restart this project or continue it with more time, I would have loved to port it into unity to add actual key binds to allow it to actually be playable. I would have also added more dialogue as well as button prompts, for example whatever button would have been used to “Dive” as the player character is falling. Porting to unity would also mean I wouldn’t have been limited to Aseprite’s pixel grid, keeping some of the assets’ actual size consistent as they are resized and rotated. I would have also liked to make some of the transitions cleaner as most of them are just jumps from one image to another.
